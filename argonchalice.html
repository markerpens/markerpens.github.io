                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">The original Argon Chalice game is a 3D platformer. The team identified that no
                    storyline was present, which made us uninterested in achieving the game's goal: to play through
                    all of the levels. Very basic mechanics were also present in the original game, such as jumping,
                    avoiding obstacles, and reaching higher platforms to finish a level. Thus, the team wanted to
                    incorporate a narrative that encouraged level completion, as well as mechanics that kept the player
                    constantly engaged in gameplay.</p>

                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">The team decided to redesign the entire game from 3D to 2D, as it was more
                    efficient to create art for the latter style. This allowed the team to focus on implementing a
                    dialogue system which allowed characters to communicate back and forth with each other during
                    gameplay, revealing to the player key plot points of the story. Tower-defense mechanics were also
                    implemented, as it matched the fact that the protagonist, Lucerna, was able to summon magical golems
                    for
                    offensive and defensive purposes.</p>

                <h2>Mendax Boss Fight</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">When the player chooses to bring the chalice back to cure Ericus, Mendax appears
                    as the final boss. Mendax possesses extreme amounts of health, yet has abysmally low speed. He
                    summons a minion every second that cannot be targeted by the player's golems.

                <p class="project-copy">When the player chooses to drink from the chalice, Lumenia appears
                    as the final boss. Lumenia possesses high speed and teleports to a random location on the map every
                    two seconds. During her teleportation phase, she summons minions that cannot be targeted by the
                    player's golems.

                <p class="project-copy"> These questions were

                    whether
                    the narrative weaves in fluidly with the gameplay, and whether it motivates players to finish
                    the
                    story. The team also wanted to see whether players adopted unique strategies to tackle each
                    wave.

                </h2>
                <p class="project-copy">The narration video did not exist during the first few iterations of the
                    game.
                    Instead, a screen full of text
                    explaining the game's backstory was implemented. Players were dissuaded from reading it due to
                    being
                    visually jarring. Thus, players were
                    unable to understand the game's storyline. Despite this, they appreciated the implementation of
                    a
                    dialogue system.</p>
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy">The team decided to implement a narration video complete with art and voice
                    acting that establishes the lore of Eisos, the characters, and their motivations. All of the
                    players
                    sat through the video, claiming that it was "intriguing." As a result, players were able to
                    understand the plot points being explained during dialogue interactions.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">Players claimed that the narration video clearly establishes Lucerna's
                    motivations as well as her backstory, which enticed them to play through the game to find out
                    more
                    about her.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy"> Some players even claimed to relate to the fact that Lucerna is shunned or
                    feared by those close to her, which acted as a catalyst for wanting to complete the game. They
                    felt
                    as if they were playing virtual versions of themselves.</p>

                <h2 class="project-copy">Did players create strategies to beat waves?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">The team designed the golems in a way that each of them can either synergize
                    well with other golems or the same types of golems. This was done through
                    careful iterations of their traits such as cost, damage, and fire rate.
                    Playtesting
                    results depict
                    that players created various strategies regarding golem placement on the map.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">For example, players would place fire golems near the spawn points of
                    enemies to
                    deal damage to many of them, softening them up for lightning golems. Some players would even
                    place
                    ice
                    golems near the chalice to slow enemies down while they used Lucerna's spells to whittle away at
                    their health.</p>

                <h2 class="project-copy">Did players find ways to counter the abilities of both Mendax and Lumenia?
                </h2>
                <p class="project-copy">The team wanted to emphasize mainly controlling Lucerna during the boss
                    battles.
                    This was done to add challenge and a way for players to feel as if Lucerna were taking matters
                    into
                    her own hands by defeating her parents.
                    In terms of gameplay, this effect was achieved by making golems unable to target the minions
                    summoned by the bosses, thus the
                    player must use their own spells to eliminate them.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">Overall, playtesting results show that players were able to develop
                    strategies
                    to counter the abilities of both Mendax and Lumenia. For Mendax, players favoured both lightning
                    golems and fire golems to chip away and Mendax's health while they focused on eliminating
                    the summoned minions. For Lumenia, players
                    preffered to use ice golems to slow her down due to her immense speed.</p>

                    critique from many playtesters, including our professor and TA.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">In spite of this, the team faced numerous challenges, such as creating an
                    alluring narrative and characters that players would care about, as well as weaving the
                    narrative in
                    seamlessly
                    with the gameplay. The team also had to learn how to use Unity in such a short time frame.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">From this experience, I learned the importance of building a solid
                    relationship
                    with team members, as well as plannning out goals and milestones to accomplish for each week. I
