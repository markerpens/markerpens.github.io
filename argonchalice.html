                <h1>Overview & Constraints</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">The team had three weeks to redesign a 3D game of the same name. We were given
                    the freedom to design our own mechanics, with the exception that we develop an alluring narrative
                    that was weaved into the gameplay. We also had to design multiple levels with varying difficulties
                    and
                    novelties to the plot and mechanics to provide enticing gameplay - all of which were absent in the
                    original Argon Chalice. </p>

                    characters, as well as its boss battles. I worked with the developers to script the gameplay, the
                    artist to conceptualize the characters, as well as the media lead to create the
                    appropriate sound and visual effects. I constructed the game design document as a guide for the team
                    to follow.

                    worked on aspects of the development process they excelled at, such as art, coding, or design. I set
                    up weekly goals and team meetings to check on progress or root out any animosity through
                    discussions. For example, we had days in the week where we would get together to discuss our
                    inspirations for narratives and compromise by either adding or removing aspects that we liked into
                    Argon Chalice's
                    narrative. This resulted in a unified ambition to create an amazing end-product.

                    Interviewees stated that such alluring stories would grant opportunities to create relatable and
                    tangible
                    characters. Thus, the team decided on creating a
                    a strong female protagonist who possesses untapped power and a tragic past - garnering inspirations
                    from strong female
                    protagonists in films such as The Hunger Games, Lucy, and Ghost In The Shell.

                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">The original Argon Chalice game is a 3D platformer. The team identified that no
                    storyline was present, which made us uninterested in achieving the game's goal: to play through
                    all of the levels. Very basic mechanics were also present in the original game, such as jumping,
                    avoiding obstacles, and reaching higher platforms to finish a level. Thus, the team wanted to
                    incorporate a narrative that encouraged level completion, as well as mechanics that kept the player
                    constantly engaged in gameplay.</p>

                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">The team decided to redesign the entire game from 3D to 2D, as it was more
                    efficient to create art for the latter style. This allowed the team to focus on implementing a
                    dialogue system which allowed characters to communicate back and forth with each other during
                    gameplay, revealing to the player key plot points of the story. Tower-defense mechanics were also
                    implemented, as it matched the fact that the protagonist, Lucerna, was able to summon magical golems
                    for
                    offensive and defensive purposes.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">The passive aspect of a tower defense game is now removed, as players are now
                    controlling a character and aiming projectiles at enemies while being able to summon golems
                    to strategically place them around the map. The result is a cohesive gameplay mechanic that
                    constantly maintains the players' engagement and invokes their ability to think tactically on their
                    feet.

                    number
                    of Essence in accordance with their utility and potency in combat. Players can also upgrade the

                <p class="project-copy">This mechanic from tower defense games coerces the player to strategically
                    manage some type of resource, which facilitates the creation of tactics to maximize the impact of

                <h1 class="project-copy">Summon Design</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">The summons are designed in a way that provides the player with constant
                    utility
                    such as high damage per second, slowing effects, and area of effect damage. This facilitates
                    strategies where players can synergize the effects of golems to unique offensive and defensive
                    combinations. For
                    example, players can summon Ice Golems in the front lines to slow the Tainted down while
                    Fire Golems deal huge area of effect damage from a distance. The player can also provide supporting
                    fire from their own spells - they can choose to be the main damage dealer or resource replenisher.

                <p class="project-copy">The team garnered inspirations from the Titans of Greek Mythology.
                    Each Titan was associated with a certain natural element, be it earth, fire, or water. Lucerna's
                    design was inspired from the Fall Of Lucifer - emphasizing on the aspect of light versus darkness,
                    as evident in Lucerna's wings and staff. This can also be seen in the visual effects of Lucerna's
                    spells, where the spells emanate a red aura while being cast then exploding into a blue aura.
                    Players found that
                    incorporating these minute details into her design bolstered her intrigue as a character.

                    battles.
                    This was done to add challenge and a way for players to feel as if Lucerna were taking matters
                    into
                    her own hands by defeating her parents.
                    In terms of gameplay, this effect was achieved by making golems unable to target the minions
                    summoned by the bosses, thus the
                    player must use their own spells to eliminate them.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">Overall, playtesting results show that players were able to develop
                    strategies
                    to counter the abilities of both Mendax and Lumenia. For Mendax, players favoured both lightning
                    golems and fire golems to chip away and Mendax's health while they focused on eliminating
                    the summoned minions. For Lumenia, players
                    preffered to use ice golems to slow her down due to her immense speed.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">In spite of this, the team faced numerous challenges, such as creating an
                    alluring narrative and characters that players would care about, as well as weaving the
                    narrative in
                    seamlessly
                    with the gameplay. The team also had to learn how to use Unity in such a short time frame.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">From this experience, I learned the importance of building a solid
                    relationship
                    with team members, as well as plannning out goals and milestones to accomplish for each week. I
                    am
                    also thankful
                    for being in a team composed of extremely hard-working individuals; without them, this project
                    wouldn't have turned out the way it did.</p>
