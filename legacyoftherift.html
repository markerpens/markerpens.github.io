                    Legacy of the Rift was a semester-long project for a class called IAT 410: Advanced Game Design. The
                    team was tasked to rapidly iterate interesting game mechanics per week, with the freedom to
                    implement any other aspects that facilitated increased player engagement. As such, our team proposed
                    this as a sequel to our previous project, <a href="https://markerpens.github.io/beyondtherift.html"
                        target="_blank" class="sfu-link">Beyond the Rift</a>, with improved combat mechanics in the form
                    of

                <p class="ability-copy">Mjoll is one of the most renowned spirit magic users in Wulfgard. Due to her
                    extreme
                    proficiency in healing and hexing, most thought that she was able to heal any form of
                    disease...except one. Mjoll accompanied Bjorn to the expedition to Shadow's End, hoping that her
                    skills will prove useful in finding a cure...

                <p class="ability-copy">In combat, Mjoll can conjure a poisonous field of gas that deals damage over
                    time to anyone caught in it. Mjoll can also summon various spirits to aid her in combat.

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pb-5">
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p class="project-copy2">A pervading problem in the initial iterations of the project was balancing the
                    3
                    Legacy abilities in a way that players could intuitively determine which character they wanted to
                    switch to based on combat circumstances.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy2">With this came another design issue: the number of abilities per character
                    which
                    may prove overwhelming for players to memorize. Due to the convention of RPG games having one
                    character with a set of abilities, wouldn't it be too much for players to manage more than one
                    character with multiple abilities, albeit remember their utility?
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution -->
            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pb-5">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p class="project-copy2">
                    The proposed solution was to devise clear utility roles for each Legacy, and to ensure that
                    abilities synergized well with one another to facilitate character switching and ultimately the
                    creation of various strategies that came such mechanics.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy2">
                    As such, Legacies were given one basic attack, one ability, and combined ultimate abilities - all of
                    which provided distinct utility and crafted a role for each of them. This came in the form of
                    a Holy Trinity system: DPS, Defense, and Healing. Secondary aspects to those roles were also added,
                    such as evasion, crowd control, and debuffing.

                <p class="project-copy"> The team gathered gathered individuals of various gaming experiences and ages
                    as a means to gauge how intuitive the mechanics and controls of the game were, as well as whether or
                    not the narrative itself bolstered the movitation to progress through the game's story.

                <h2 class="project-copy">Were players able to remember the utility of each of the 3 Legacies?
                </h2>
                <p class="project-copy">Initially, each Legacy had one basic attack, two abilities, and one ability.
                    This resulted in playtesters struggling to remember which Legacy abilities provided the needed
                    utility during combat situations. The ultimate abilities were also rarely used.</p>
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy">As such, we reduced the abilities by 1 and combined the ultimate abilities
                    and their effects together. This more clearly defined the roles for each Legacy,
                    and players had a less of a cognitive strain remembering the effects of each ability.

                </h2>
                <p class="project-copy">Initially, players gravitated towards Halvar, as his kit provided the most
                    impact in combat during initial iterations. This was also due to enemy combat styles providing no
                    counter-play against his wall. As such, Gorewings were introduced, in which they could fly over
                    Halvar's wall and attack the party.
                <p>

                <p class="project-copy">Other enemy types also provided counter-play against the rest of the Legacy
                    kits. Botchlings pounced towards the player, requiring them to time Lokir's dash to phase through
                    them. Spear Mares threw spears from a distance, punishing those who played too defensively through
                    Ursa's healing. This
                    facilitated switching between the Legacies to create diverse strategies and ability combinations to
                    tackle each level.

                <p class="project-copy4"> Legacy of the Rift is a culmination (a sequel) of previous academic projects
                    from our IAT
                    313: Narrative and
                    New Media class, and as such, we have already built a world-building base as well as avid players
                    who were familiar with its characters. Even so, the team aimed to ensure that it could also be a
                    standalone game.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy4">Through weekly rapid iterations, I further bolstered my scripting skills and
                    the efficiency at which I ideated, prototyped, and implemented game mechanics that resonated well
                    with player experiences.
