                    The team was constrained to a two-week deadline to create a interactive narrative novel for a class
                    called IAT 313: Narrative & New Media. The story must have branching endings, as well as outcomes
                    which would be determined by the choices of the player. The team decided to develop the project in
                    Unity due to our familiarity with the program and the fact that it gave us the versatility in
                    implementing more complex narrative mechanics. </p>

                    resided inside
                    of him is the reason why he possesses such powers. As such, I proposed that we create a game based
                    on that character with a narrative that explored his tribulations of supressing the evil within
                    him.

                    the endings that players got in their playthroughs instead of constraining them to the ending that
                    reflected the moral compass of their choices. Thus, replayability is encouraged.

                    as well as whether they could quickly grasp the combat mechanics present in the mini-games.

                    not inherently a flaw, many of the players gravitated towards good dialogue choices. Thus, I altered
                    the dialogue in a way that did not make the moral compass of choices as obvious. Despite this, the
                    consequences of the choices is still implied. This again, contributed to diverse playthroughs and
                    choice selection.</p>

                    that a replay button did not exist. The team quickly implemented a way for players to return to the
                    main menu during the credits of the ending scene(s), thus facilitating replayability.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p class="project-copy"> It was a challenge for the team to create a game that was solely focused on
                    branching narratives, as
                    we had no experience them. With only two weeks to create one, we had to
                    delegate roles to each member to play to their strengths. To achieve this, the team set up daily
                    meetings to tackle
                    particular goals of the development cycle.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy">One prominent challenge of this constraint was developing
                    a fully-functioning dialogue system. As such, we utilized Fungus to save time, enabling us to focus
                    on other aspects of the game such as the quality of the dialogue, the finesse of the art, and the
                    combat mechanics
                    of the
                    mini-games. Each team member performed impeccably, and we delivered a game that reflects our love
                    and passion for the craft. </p>
