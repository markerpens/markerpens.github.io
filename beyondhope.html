                <h1 class="project-copy">Mechanics</h1>
                <p class="ability-copy">The abilities are designed in a way that provides the player with sustained
                    utility
                    such as faster movement, healing, and area of effect damage. This facilitates a fast-paced
                    gameplay
                    where the player is constantly making tactical choices in combat instead of mindlessly clicking
                    abilities to reap benefits. For instance, a movement ability can be used to dash away from a
                    horde of Revenants, creating space to safely activate a healing ability. Conversely, an area of
                    effect ability can be used to create more space for the player to achieve the same effect.

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content py-5">
                <h1 class="project-copy">Inspiration</h1>
                <p class="ability-copy">I garnered inspiration from the combat of games such as Kingdom Hearts and
                    God
                    Of
                    War, as these games design combat in such a way that encapsulates the personality of
                    their protagonists. For instance, Sora utilizes fast, graceful movements to deliver
                    a flurry of attacks. Kratos prefers to deliver killing blows with minimal, brutish attacks. With
                    Avernus, I
                    wanted to encapsulate years of combat experience by animating him so that he puts his entire
                    body
                    weight into
                    his swings and dashes to maximize the leverages of his blows.

                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p class="project-copy2">I found that role-playing games that rely on abilities to drive combat, such
                    as
                    Dragon
                    Age: Origins, were too repetitive. It was mostly static, wherein players would stand in one spot
                    auto-attacking an enemy while occassionally pressing other buttons to activate abilities.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution -->
            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content py-sm-5 pb-5">
                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p class="project-copy2">I implemented more dynamic a combat system where players could swing their
                    weapons manually
                    instead of auto-attacking.
                    To divert away from the passive nature of clicking abilities in older role-playing games, I
                    developed a more engaging ability system that provided players with utility and tactical
                    benefits.

                <h2 class="project-copy">Who were the playtesters?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">
                    I gathered playtesters of various gaming experiences, ranging from avid role-playing gamers to
                    non-gamers. This was done to investigate whether players from both ends of the spectrum were
                    able to
                    quickly grasp the game mechanics to formulate unique strategies with abilities.</p>

                <h2 class="project-copy">Were mana costs and cooldowns balanced?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">To facilitate fast-paced gameplay, cooldowns for abilities were
                    relatively
                    short and the mana costs were low. This caused players to spam abilities without much
                    drawback; for
                    example, players were able to use their ultimate ability, "Salvation," multiple times in one
                    wave.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy">Such exploits were resolved by balancing the mana cost and cooldown in
                    relation
                    to ability's power. Abilities like "Salvation" were given a high cost and cooldown due
                    to being able to wipe out multiple enemies in a vast radius, as opposed to abilities like
                    "Perdition" and "Thunderstride" which dealt damage to enemies in a much smaller radius.</p>

                <h2 class="project-copy">Were the spawn rates too fast or too slow?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">Playtesting results depict that the spawn rates (the spawn time and
                    spawn
                    amount) during the initial
                    phases of the game were too fast, which caused players to become overwhelmed during the
                    first few
                    waves. Thus, players were blindly using abilities and playing very imprudently due to
                    frustration.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy"> This was addressed
                    by decreasing the spawn time from 0.5 seconds to 2 seconds per Revenant spawned. The amount
                    of
                    Revenants spawned per wave was also decreased slightly. As a result, players were able to
                    ease into
                    learning the game's mechanics and the purpose of each ability.</p>

                <h2 class="project-copy">Were any abilities overused or underused?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">Initially, each swing of "Divine Onslaught" restored mana and was able
                    to hit
                    multiple enemies. Many players resorted to just using this ability due to its low risk,
                    high reward nature. Thus, the other abilities were ignored due to putting players in a
                    compromised
                    state when using them.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">To remedy this issue, "Divine Onslaught" was altered so that only the
                    last swing
                    would restore mana and deal damage to multiple enemies. This made players manage their mana
                    and time
                    their
                    attacks more prudently. As a result, the other abilities began to see more usage.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">Players were able to quickly grasp that the abilities synergized with one
                    another. A common tactic was to utilize "Thunderstride" to get away from a horde to safely use
                    "Hellfire Flux."</p>

                <p class="project-copy">This was exactly what I intended to invoke in my game design. What I also
                    noticed was veteran role-playing gamers would use the map's terrain to their advantage - they
                    would
                    position themselves in narrow pathways to create choke points and use area of effect abilities
                    to
                    flush out large hordes.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">
                    I wanted to challenge myself and create a 3D role-playing game in my first game
                    engine, Unreal Engine 4. I gave myself four months to incorporate all of the aspects I loved about
                    role-playing games
                    and develop a simple, replayable game with engaging and satisfying combat mechanics. This project
                    was also a means for me to further bolster my skills as a game developer and designer.

                <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">I scripted the entirety of the game including the enemy AI, the wave system, and
                    the combat system. From this, I was able to become a more efficient scripter - I could now utilize
                    visual scripting as a testing method to create pseudo-scripts before programmatically coding them in
                    future projects. Thus, being able to visualize how scripts were linked together enabled me to
                    understand the programming side of scripting more.

                <p class="project-copy">The process of this project was never linear, as I constantly iterated on
                    this
                    project based on feedback from playtesters. In hindsight, it was extremely ambitious of me to
                    create a 3D game on an engine I've never used before.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">Even so, I was able to overcome the steep learning curve by setting goals
                    to accomplish by the end of every week, be it learning how to efficiently use the Blueprint
                    System
                    or learning how to animate characters. I
                    would
                    dedicate at least 2
                    hours of my day reading documentation and watching tutorials.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">From this experience, I also learned the importance of perseverance. There
                    were days where I would ask myself, "Why am I doing this? This is too much for one person."
                    Nevertheless, I conquered that mentality in hopes of seeing my vision come to life and
                    seeing players enjoy my game.</p>
