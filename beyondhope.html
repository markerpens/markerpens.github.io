            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content py-5">
                <h1>Premise</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">In the world of Terros, an epidemic known as the Bloodlust Plague ravages
                    the
                    entire planet. Both mortals and Gods infected with the disease turned into creatures known as
                    Revenants, who
                    crave nothing but flesh and blood. Avernus, the God of Thunder and Hellfire, is the last living
                    being standing in Terros. Will he survive?</p>

                <p class="project-copy">Writing short backstories acts as a brainstorming process for creating the
                    game's mechanics. In this case, it helped me determine the incorporation of role-playing
                    elements
                    such
                    as activating abilities, as
                    well as zombie survival elements, such as fighting perpetual hordes of enemies.</p>

                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">I found that role-playing games that rely on abilities to drive combat, such
                    as
                    Dragon
                    Age: Origins, were too repetitive. It was mostly static, wherein players would stand in one spot
                    auto-attacking an enemy while occassionally pressing other buttons to activate skills.</p>

                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p class="project-copy">I implemented more dynamic a combat system where players could swing their
                    weapons manually
                    instead of auto-attacking.
                    Players could also activate abilities that enabled them to either
                    manuever around the map more effectively or deal damage to multiple enemies at once.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h1>Playtesting</h1>

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h2 class="project-copy">What were the results?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">
                    By creating various
                    questions that target potential unbalanced aspects of the game such as abilities and spawn rates, it
                    helped me balance them
                    accordingly by analyzing the playtesting results.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h1>01</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h2 class="project-copy">Were mana costs and cooldowns balanced?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">To facilitate fast-paced gameplay, cooldowns for abilities were
                    relatively
                    short and the mana costs were low. This caused players to spam abilities without much
                    drawback; for
                    example, players were able to use their ultimate ability, "Salvation," multiple times in one
                    wave.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy">Such exploits were resolved by balancing the mana cost and cooldown in
                    relation
                    to ability's power. Abilities like "Salvation" were given a high cost and cooldown due
                    to being able to wipe out multiple enemies in a vast radius, as opposed to abilities like
                    "Perdition" and "Thunderstride" which dealt damage to enemies in a much smaller radius.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h1>02</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h2 class="project-copy">Were the spawn rates too fast or too slow?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">Playtesting results depict that the spawn rates (the spawn time and
                    spawn
                    amount) during the initial
                    phases of the game were too fast, which caused players to become overwhelmed during the
                    first few
                    waves. Thus, players were blindly using abilities and playing very imprudently due to
                    frustration.
                </p>

                <p class="project-copy"> This was addressed
                    by decreasing the spawn time from 0.5 seconds to 2 seconds per Revenant spawned. The amount
                    of
                    Revenants spawned per wave was also decreased slightly. As a result, players were able to
                    ease into
                    learning the game's mechanics and the purpose of each ability.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h1>03</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content pt-5">
                <h2 class="project-copy">Were any abilities overused or underused?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">Initially, each swing of "Divine Onslaught" restored mana and was able
                    to hit
                    multiple enemies. Many players resorted to just using this ability due to its low risk,
                    high reward nature. Thus, the other abilities were ignored due to putting players in a
                    compromised
                    state when using them.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">To remedy this issue, "Divine Onslaught" was altered so that only the
                    last swing
                    would restore mana and deal damage to multiple enemies. This made players manage their mana
                    and time
                    their
                    attacks more prudently. As a result, the other abilities began to see more usage.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-project-content py-5">
                <h2 class="project-copy">Did players combo their abilities?</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">The abilities were designed in such a way that players could create
                    various
                    combos with them. This was seen prominently during playthrough sessions.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">For example, many players used "Divine Onslaught" in conjunction with
                    "Perdition" to
                    create a 4-hit combo. Many of them would also use "Thunderstride" to
                    dash to a safe spot on the map then immediately heal with "Hellfire Flux."</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p class="project-copy">The process of this project was never linear, as I constantly iterated on this
                    project based on feedback from playtesters. In hindsight, it was extremely ambitious of me to
                    create a 3D game on an engine I've never used before.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">Even so, I was able to overcome the steep learning curve by setting goals
                    to accomplish by the end of every week, be it learning how to efficiently use the Blueprint System
                    or learning how to animate characters. I
                    would
                    dedicate at least 2
                    hours of my day reading documentation and watching tutorials.</p>

                <p class="project-copy">From this experience, I also learned the importance of perseverance. There
                    were days where I would ask myself, "Why am I doing this? This is too much for one person."
                    Nevertheless, I conquered that mentality in hopes of seeing my vision come to life and
                    seeing players enjoy my game.</p>
